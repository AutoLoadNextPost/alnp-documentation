# Auto Load Next Post Documentation

## Post Navigation

The post navigation is an important part in order for Auto Load Next Post to work. Most themes should have one applied for single posts, preferrably at the end of the article.

### My theme does not have a post navigation

If the theme that you are using does **not** have a post navigation then you will need to add one. The [Next and Previous Links](https://codex.wordpress.org/Next_and_Previous_Links) guide available at WordPress.org will help you along.

Once you have a post navigation applied, Auto Load Next Post is ready.
