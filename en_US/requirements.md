# Auto Load Next Post Documentation

## Requirements

Auto Load Next Post requires that you have at least WordPress version **4.7** or above running with PHP version **5.6** or above. This is the minimum the plugin was developed from.

Auto Load Next Post also requires a theme or framework that follows the [WordPress theme code standards](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Theme_Development_Standards). Having a WordPress theme that is not bundled with too many features or options that affect the template structure also helps for a better and smoother setup.

Auto Load Next Post is designed to be open as much as possible to allow customization but there are limits so starting with a WordPress theme that is well developed is important to have.

A lot of users have requested support for themes that do not follow these requirements and while I am doing my best to do so it is not always possible.

Your theme must also have a post navigation at the end of your single posts. This allows Auto Load Next Post to find out which post to load next.

> ℹ️ Dev Note: _In the future this will be a database query based so themes without a post navigation can be used._
