This is a collection of theme selectors that I have found among the many themes tested with Auto Load Next Post. You can use the tables below to check against when looking for your themes theme selectors.

> ✏️ Note: The first selector per table is commonly used in most newer themes and themes that follow WordPress code standards.

If you find a theme selector that is not yet listed, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/autoloadnextpost/alnp-documentation/issues/new) in this repository to report it. Thank you!
