# Auto Load Next Post Documentation

## Content Container

The content container is a crucial part and is where the posts will be loaded in via Ajax. Without the content container, Auto Load Next Post will not be able to insert the next post correctly to keep the design of the content consistant.

Weither the theme you have active has a sidebar on a single post or not the single post should have a primary section. This allows the posts to be layered in one by one as new posts are loaded in.
