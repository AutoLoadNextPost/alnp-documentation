# Auto Load Next Post Documentation

## Installation

Auto Load Next Post is available as a WordPress plugin through the plugin directory. Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser.

To do an automatic install of Auto Load Next Post, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the 'Plugins' menu and press 'Add New'.

In the search field type **Auto Load Next Post** and press 'Search Plugins'. Once you’ve found the plugin, you can install it by simply pressing 'Install Now'. Once installed the button will change to 'Activate'.

After activating the plugin you will be welcomed and told if the active theme already supports Auto Load Next Post out of the box or requires following the documentation.

See [list of themes](https://github.com/AutoLoadNextPost/alnp-documentation/blob/master/supported-themes.md) that work out of the box.


### Manual Installation

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex [contains instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

1. [Download the plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/auto-load-next-post/) from WordPress.org
2. Extract the zip file you just downloaded.
3. Upload the entire `/auto-load-next-post` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins` directory.
4. Activate Auto Load Next Post through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
