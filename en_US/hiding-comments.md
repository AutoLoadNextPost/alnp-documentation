# How to Hide Comments

Blogs with high activity tend to have a lot of comments per post and with Auto Load Next Post enabled that can increase the amount of scrolling involved for your readers for each post they read so it doesn’t make sense to leave them on. However, Auto Load Next Post allows you to hide the comments.

To hide the comments:

1. Go to **Settings -> Auto Load Next Post** screen in the admin panel.
2. Make sure the **Comments Container** selector is set.
3. Go to the **Misc** section.
4. Enable remove comments.
5. Press the **Save settings** button.

Now when you view any post the comments are no longer shown making the content load quicker and focus your readers on your post content.

## Can I still view a post comments or respond to a post?

Yes. To view comments for a single post or to respond to a post, simply view that post with either hashtag at the end of the post URL.
